# SINGLE LINKED LIST IMPLEMENTATION

## Common Information
This project offers a single linked list implementation for JS.
It includes:

* two classes: one is for Nodes (list elements) and another for Linked List itself
* methods for LinkedList class

The project also includes 39 tests for checking accuracy of the method.


## Methods
Current realization of Linked List has the following methods:

* `size()` - return the number of elements in List

* `isEmpty()` - returns `true` or `false`

* `indexOf(value)` - returns index of the first element in the List, which has `value`

* `elementAt(index)` - return value of the element, which has `index` in the List

* `addLast(value)` - adds an element with `value` in the end of the List

* `addFirst(value)` - adds an element with `value` in the begining of the List

* `addAt(index, value)` - insert an element with `value` at the `index` position in the List

* `removeAt(index)` - removes an element from List by `index`

* `removeFirst()` - removes the first element from the List

* `removeLast()` - removes the last element from the List
